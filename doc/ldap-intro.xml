    <title>Foreword</title>

    <para>This text is intended as a quick introduction to the
    interesting bits of the LDAP protocol, and should be useful
    whether you are managing an LDAP server, programming something
    using an LDAP library, or writing an LDAP library yourself. I
    welcome any feedback you might have.</para>

    <title>LDAP Presents a Distributed Tree of Information</title>

    <para>Probably the nicest way to get a mental model of LDAP
    information is to think of a tree with elements both in leaf and
    non-leaf nodes. Parts of the tree may reside at different LDAP
    servers.</para>

      <title>Tree-like, distributed nature of data stored in LDAP</title>
      <graphic fileref="ldap-is-a-tree.dot.eps.png"/>
    </figure>

    <para>An organization normally uses their DNS domain name as the
    root entry for their local LDAP tree. For example,
    <literal>example.com</literal> is free to use
    <literal>dc=example,dc=com</literal>. The <literal>dc</literal>
    stands for <literal>domainComponent</literal>. An alternative is
    to identify the organization via geographical location, as in
    <literal>o=Example Inc., c=US</literal>, but this is cumbersome as
    it requires registration to avoid name conflicts.</para>

    <para>Each node of the tree is called an "LDAP entry", and can
    contain multiple attributes in the form of
    <replaceable>attributeType</replaceable>=<replaceable>value</replaceable>
    pairs, for example <literal>surname=Wiesel</literal>. One
    attributeType may appear multiple times, in effect having multiple
    values.</para>

    <para>One or more of the attributes are chosen as a Relative
    Distinguished Name<indexterm><primary>Relative Distinguished
    Name</primary><secondary>RDN</secondary></indexterm>, and will be
    used to identify the node based on its parent. This means the RDN
    must be unique among the children of its parent. Listing all the
    RDNs, separated by commas, from the node to the root, gives us the
    Distinguished Name<indexterm><primary>Distinguished
    Name</primary><secondary>DN</secondary></indexterm> of the
    entry.</para>

    <informalexample>
      <para>The RDN of the entry for
      <personname><firstname>Jack</firstname>
      <othername>E.</othername> <surname>Wiesel</surname></personname>
      is <literal>cn=Jack E. Wiesel</literal>. The DN is
      <literal>cn=Jack
      E. Wiesel,ou=Sales,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com</literal>.</para>
    </informalexample>

  </chapter>

  <chapter>
    <title>Objectclasses and Schemas</title>

    <para>A special attributeType of <literal>objectClass</literal>
    lists all the objectclasses the LDAP entry manifests. An object
    class basically lists what attribute types an entry must have, and
    what optional attribute types it may have. For example, telephone
    directory entries must have a name and a telephone number, and may
    have a fax number and street address.
    <literal>objectClass</literal> can have multiple values, allowing
    the same entry to describe e.g. information about a person both
    for a telephone directory and for UNIX shell login.</para>

    <para>An LDAP schema is a part of the configuration of the LDAP
    server, containing two things: definitions of attribute types and
    definitions of objectclasses.  It is normally stored as ASCII
    text, but can e.g. be requested from the server over an LDAP
    connection.</para>

    <para>An attribute type definition commonly contains a global
    identifier for the attribute type (a list of period-separated
    integers), a list of names for the attribute type, a free-form
    description and a reference to another attribute type this
    definition inherits from.  It may also contain information about
    what sort of data the attribute values may contain, how to compare
    and sort them, how to find substrings in the value, whether the
    attribute type can have multiple values, etc.</para>

    <example>
      <title>An example attributeType definition</title>
      <programlisting>
attributetype ( 2.5.4.4 NAME ( 'sn' 'surname' )
	DESC 'RFC2256: last (family) name(s) for which the entity is known by'
	SUP name )
      </programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>An object class definition also commonly contains a global
    identifier, name, description and inheritance information.  It
    also commonly lists the attribute types entries having this object
    class must have, and additional attribute types they may have. An
    entry cannot have attribute types that are not listed as a
    <literal>MUST</literal> or <literal>MAY</literal> by one of the
    entrys object classes or their parents.</para>

    <example>
      <title>An example objectClass definition</title>
      <programlisting>
objectclass ( 2.5.6.6 NAME 'person'
	DESC 'RFC2256: a person'
	SUP top STRUCTURAL
	MUST ( sn $ cn )
	MAY ( userPassword $ telephoneNumber $ seeAlso $ description ) )
      </programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>There are a lot of pre-existing schemas, standardized in
    various RFCs. Also, anyone can create their own schemas. The only
    things you need are access to the LDAP server configuration, and a
    number reserved for you, which can be achieved by filling a web
    form.</para>

  </chapter>

  <chapter>
    <title>Object-oriented look at LDAP entries</title>

    <para>If you look at LDAP entries from the viewpoint of a
    programmer accustomed with object oriented programming, you will
    see a lot of similarities, but also some striking differences:</para>

  <chapter>
    <title>Writing Things Down: LDIF</title>

    <para>There is a standardized way of writing down, in plain text,
    the contents of LDAP directories, individual entries and even add,
    delete and modify operations. This format is known as LDIF (LDAP
    Data Interchange
    Format)<indexterm><primary>LDIF</primary><secondary>LDAP Data
    Interchange Format</secondary></indexterm>, and it is defined in
    RFC2849.</para>

    <para>The rough format of LDIF is this: there is a paragraph per
    entry, where paragraphs are separated by blank lines. Each
    paragraph contains lines in the format
    <computeroutput><replaceable>keyword</replaceable>:
    <replaceable>value</replaceable></computeroutput>. Entries start
    by listing the keyword <computeroutput>dn</computeroutput>, and
    their DN, and then list all the attributes and values the entry
    has. Lines starting with space are appended to the previous
    line. The whole file starts with the keyword
    <computeroutput>version</computeroutput> and value
    <computeroutput>1</computeroutput>.

      <footnote>
	<para>The actual format is more complex, but this tutorial
	should allow you to read and write normal LDIF files
	fluently.</para>
      </footnote>
    </para>

    <example>
      <title>A simple LDAP file with two entries.</title>

    <title>Searches and Search Filters</title>

    <para>The most common LDAP operation is a search, and LDAP is
    purposefully designed for environments where searches are many
    times more common than modify operations. In general, LDAP servers
    index the entries and can effectively search for matches against a
    reasonably complex criteria among thousands of entries.</para>

    <para>An LDAP search takes the following information as input:
      <footnote>
	<para>Once again, we are skipping some details for
	understandability.</para>
      </footnote>
    </para>

    &search_inputs;

    <para>Of these, the search filter is clearly the most interesting
    one. As with LDIF, search filters have a standardized plain text
    representation, even though they are not transmitted as plain text
    in the actual protocol.</para>

    <para>A search filter is basically a combination of tests an entry
    must fulfill in order to match the filter. They are always written
    inside parentheses. A simple example would be

      <informalexample>
	<para><literal>(cn=John Smith)</literal></para>
      </informalexample>

    but the filters can also match against presence, prefix, suffix,
    substring, rough equality, etc. Multiple matches can be combined
    freely with and, or and not operators, which are represented by
    <literal>&amp;</literal>, <literal>|</literal> and
    <literal>!</literal>, respectively. For example, to match only
    objects that have objectClass <literal>person</literal>, where the
    full name contains the letters a and b in either order, and who
    don't have a telephone number listed, we could use the filter

      <footnote>
	<para>Yes, once again we are skipping details for
	understandability. See RFC2254 for more.</para>
      </footnote>

      <informalexample>
	<para><literal>(&amp;(objectClass=person)(!(telephoneNumber=*))(|(cn=*a*b*)(cn=*b*a*)))</literal></para>
      </informalexample>
    </para>

    <title>Phases of an LDAP Protocol Chat</title>

    <para>An average LDAP protocol chat consists of three stages:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Opening the connection</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>Doing one or more searches</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>Closing the connection</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>At the first stage, opening a connection, an LDAP client
    opens a TCP connection to the LDAP server, either as plain text,
    encrypted by TLS or starting with plaintext and switching to use
    TLS with STARTTLS.</para>

    <para>The client authenticates itself and/or the user, providing
    any necessary authentication information. This is called
    binding<indexterm><primary>binding</primary></indexterm>. Normally,
    the connection is not really authenticated, but left as anonymous;
    the bind message is sent with no user or password
    information.</para>

    <figure>
      <title>Beginning of an LDAP protocol chat</title>
      <graphic fileref="chat-bind.dot.eps.png"/>
    </figure>

    <para>Next, the client sends a search request, containing the base
    DN for the search, the filter that entries must fulfill to match,
    and some extra settings discussed above.</para>

    <para>The server replies by sending search result entries back,
    one message per matching entry. If no entry matched or there was
    an error before the search could even start, the server might not
    send any entries. Finally, the server sends a message indicating
    the search is done, and includes information on whether the search
    was completely successfully, or the error encountered.</para>

    <figure>
      <title>A sample LDAP search operation</title>
      <graphic fileref="chat-search.dot.eps.png"/>
    </figure>

    <para>Note that the client could have sent another search request
    without waiting for the first search to complete. The order of
    results from the different search, or when they are completed, is
    in no way guaranteed.</para>

    <figure>
      <title>Multiple search operations pipelined</title>
      <graphic fileref="chat-search-pipeline.dot.eps.png"/>
    </figure>

    <para>One important detail we have skimmed over so far is how the
    LDAP client knows what message the server is replying to. Earlier
    we avoided this topic just by doing only one thing at a time, but
    now we have two searches getting their result entries
    interleaved. Clearly, there must be a mechanism to separate which
    entries belong to which search request. And exactly such a
    mechanism exists; each message sent by the client contains a
    number identifying the request, and the server replies by
    including the same number in the reply. Now, all the client needs
    to do is remember which numbers are still in use, and not reuse
    those. It can internally maintain search state based on these
    numbers, and process result entries based on them. The client can
    reuse a number when it is known that no more server replies will
    be sent using that number; for example, the search done message
    gives this guarantee.</para>

    <para>Finally, when the client longer wants to talk to the server,
    it sends a message effectively saying "good bye". This message is
    known as <literal>unbind</literal>. This only means that the state
    of connection is the same as when connected, before the first
    <literal>bind</literal>; that is, it unauthenticates the current
    user. If the client really wants to close the connection, it will
    then close the TCP socket.</para>

    <figure>
      <title>End of an LDAP protocol chat</title>
      <graphic fileref="chat-unbind.dot.eps.png"/>
    </figure>

    <para>Please understand that these were just examples, and in
    reality protocol chats are often more complicated. For example,
    one could connect some other protocol servers, say a web servers,
    authentication mechanism to actually act as an LDAP client, that
    tries to bind as the user authenticating himself to the web
    server, with the password given by the user. If this service had
    no other interest in the contents of LDAP, it would probably
    immediately after the bind close the connection. But opening and
    closing TCP connections repeatedly is slow; it is quite likely the
    authentication mechanism would be changed to keep a single TCP
    connection alive, and just do repeated binds over the same
    connection.</para>
