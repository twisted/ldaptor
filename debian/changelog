ldaptor (0.0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bring test suite up to date.
  * Beginnings of a more Pythonic LDAP API.
  * Make ldapclient.LDAPModifyAttributes use Deferreds.
  * Pass ldapclient when creating LDAPObject, not at every use.
  * Simplify filter handling in ldaptor-search.
  * Add comparison functions for LDAPObjects.

    processing search results one by one.
  * Support creating API docs with epydoc.
  * Add bin/ldaptor-ldap2pdns
  * Docs and TODO update.
  * Allow empty base setting.
  * Support for parsing and generating string representations of

  * Support for finding the domain name, and via DNS SRV, the
    server, related to an LDAP DN.
  * ldaptor-webui SRV support: options --host and --port are gone,
    finds LDAP servers for domainComponent-style DNs via DNS SRV
    records. If you don't have them, and don't want to fix that,
    use --service-location='dc=example,dc=com:ldap.example.com'.

  * Make DistinguishedName hashable.
  * Use the client for this session to fetch the attributes, don't
    open up a new connection.

    were no sharedNets.
  * Fix an uninterruptible infinite loop in ldaptor-webui
    shutdown.

ldaptor (0.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * NOTE: Requires a CVS version of twisted!
  * NOTE: Upgrade from 0.0.1 can fail.
  * Split package into library, ldaptor-webui and
    ldaptor-utils. Support multiple python versions in library.
  * Added new command line utilities:
    - ldaptor-namingcontexts to list naming contexts of a server.
    - ldaptor-ldap2dhcpconf is the start of a tool to export host
      entries from LDAP in a format suitable for a DHCP server.
    - ldaptor-ldap2maradns does pretty much the same for DNS, in
      (partial) maradns zone format; it was just so much easier.
    - note that the ldaptor-ldap2{dhcpconf,maradns} input format
      will change as I try to cram in a few more features
      (separate physical network location from DNS domain -- they
      are currently bound together).
    - ldaptor-search aims to be a full replacement for ldapsearch.
    - ldaptor-passwd allows changing passwords (as per RFC3062).
  * ldaptor-webui:
    - added support for "Advanced" searching with raw LDAP filter
      strings.
    - change parameter --port to --http-port, for clarity.
    - fix navi links.
  * Make all LDAP server, port and base settings explicit.
  * Add ldapfilter and ldif modules.
  * Create ldaptor.usage to store common option processing.
  * Change twisted.python.defer to twisted.internet.defer and
    twisted.protocols.protocol to twisted.internet.protocol.
  * Handle unsolicited LDAP notifications.
  * New test subsystem.
  * Rewrite LDAP protocol error number storage to be
    bi-directional; you can resolve a number to a string.
