ldaptor (0.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * NOTE: Requires a CVS version of twisted!
  * NOTE: Upgrade from 0.0.1 can fail.
  * Split package into library, ldaptor-webui and
    ldaptor-utils. Support multiple python versions in library.
  * Added new command line utilities:
    - ldaptor-namingcontexts to list naming contexts of a server.
    - ldaptor-ldap2dhcpconf is the start of a tool to export host
      entries from LDAP in a format suitable for a DHCP server.
    - ldaptor-ldap2maradns does pretty much the same for DNS, in
      (partial) maradns zone format; it was just so much easier.
    - note that the ldaptor-ldap2{dhcpconf,maradns} input format
      will change as I try to cram in a few more features
      (separate physical network location from DNS domain -- they
      are currently bound together).
    - ldaptor-search aims to be a full replacement for ldapsearch.
    - ldaptor-passwd allows changing passwords (as per RFC3062).
  * ldaptor-webui:
    - added support for "Advanced" searching with raw LDAP filter
      strings.
    - change parameter --port to --http-port, for clarity.
    - fix navi links.
  * Make all LDAP server, port and base settings explicit.
  * Add ldapfilter and ldif modules.
  * Create ldaptor.usage to store common option processing.
  * Change twisted.python.defer to twisted.internet.defer and
    twisted.protocols.protocol to twisted.internet.protocol.
  * Handle unsolicited LDAP notifications.
  * New test subsystem.
  * Rewrite LDAP protocol error number storage to be
    bi-directional; you can resolve a number to a string.
